If the red and green bars are similar size, you can tell it was a close game and the winning team barely won. The graph also shows each season year and day the game was played.

As well as low scores, it is also unlikely a team wins with an extremely high number of points, but they sometimes do. Scores of over 110 have only been achieved seven times.

Overall, there really isn't a trend across the seasons, they didn't get worse or better over time, just ups and downs. Since there is no trend in the scores over the years, the takeaway from the graph is just to see the scores of the Ohio State team across each season."
